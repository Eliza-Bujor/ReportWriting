A good report is the difference between a good security analyst and a great security analyst. It will the ability to clearly and concisely get across information from the observed attack, as well as the analysis steps used on the email and artifacts and the actions taken in order to protect the organisaiton.
<br />

<h2>Objectives</h2>
- Clear and consice information delivery <br />
- Email description and a list of email, web, and file artifacts<br />
- Analysis of the email and artifacts<br />
- Suggest defensive measures<br />
<br />

<h2>Challenge Brief</h2>
A fellow security analyst began investigating a phishing email but has had to stop and join an incident response team with a potential system compromise, so they have passed over their rough notes to you. Whilst the investigating analyst had almost completed their assessment, they didn’t have time to write up their report and select appropriate defensive measures. Using the analyst’s notes you need to take over their investigation and write a full report detailing the actions that they took in a neat and presentable format, and suggest defensive measures that would best protect the company. The initial analyst has mentioned that you should just keep the case for yourself, and talk as if you have completed the actions instead of referring to him throughout the report.
